## Project Description:<a name="projectdescription"></a>
The purpose of this project is to reverse engineer a full-stack web application using Express, Mode.js, Mongoose and MongoDB.  Our team had selected the blogging website Medium because of our interest in blogs and the type of documents and relationships in our database.  For our web application, we have built capabilities for users to create an account with user authentication, to create blog posts and make reviews of other user's blog posts.

## Goals and Stretch Features:<a name="goalsandstretchfeatures"></a>

### Goals:
1. Build and reverse engineer a functional full-stack web application.
2. Have 3 key features within our site.
3. Design user flow and provide an improvement on design flow.
4. Minimum of 2 databases.
5. Full CRUD functionality.
6. Express app that renders HTML pages from EJS templates.
7. RESTful Routes designed with REST convention.
8. Use EJS to render objects from MongoDB.
9. Design and demonstrate dastabase document relationship(s) (one-to-many or many-to-many).
10. Style design with CSS flexbox, grid, bootstrap or other CSS framework.
11. Deploy on Heroku.

### Stretch Goals:
1. Establish User Authentication (user login/logout and registeration).
2. Allow users to have an avatar profile picture.
3. Create user privelges (i.e. edit, delete posts, comment and review article).
4. Establish an embedded model to measure likes on an article.
5. Measure article read time using a functional algorithm.
6. Create a home "Start Reading" button to allow a user to read a random article from the database.
7. Create a "Our Story" route to github repository.

This section describes the planning process and planning designs of how our web application.

### User Flow and Database Relationship
The picture below describes loosely how the user flow would be established.  This is not exact how the finally product is represented, but the planning phase of this project allowed us to plan ahead of and establish goals of our web application. The everday lay-user will start on the home page, which is the index page of the articles that the lay-user can browse and select an article to read.  Lay-user can read articles, but will not be able to create or comment on articles unless they register as a user.  Once logged-in, users can like, comment and review articles that they read.  User can also edit and delete their own

## Tech Stack:<a name="techstack"></a>
#### HTML, CSS
HTML was used to structure and organize the containers, elements, forms, buttons and other tags on EJS files.  Partials were also made to simplify web page elements (i.e. navbar) and grant access to user privileges (i.e. comment section).

#### JavaScript
JavaScript was used on EJS files to give funtionality on the index and show pages by displaying articles and comments.  It also gave functionality to our user stories like the random "Start Reading" button and the read time algorithm.

#### Node.js

#### Express

#### Postman

#### MongoDB

#### Mongoose
