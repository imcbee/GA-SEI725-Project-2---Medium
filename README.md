## Project Description: <a name="projectdescription"></a>
The purpose of this project is to reverse engineer a full-stack web application using Express, Mode.js, Mongoose and MongoDB.  Our team had selected the blogging website Medium because of our interest in the type of documents for our database.  For our web application, we have built capabilities for users to create an account with user authentication, to create blog posts and make reviews of other user's blog posts.

## Goals and Stretch Features:<a name="goalsandstretchfeatures"></a>

### Goals:
1. Build and reverse engineer a functional full-stack web application.
2. Have 3 key features within our site (MVP).
3. Design user flow and provide an improvement on design flow.
4. Minimum of 2 databases.
5. Full CRUD functionality.

### Stretch Goals:
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
